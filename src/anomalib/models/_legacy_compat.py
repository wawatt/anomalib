"""Import shims for checkpoints trained before the timm-encoder migration.

Several DINOv2-based models used to build their encoder from a custom Vision Transformer that
lived in modules which have since been removed (the ``DinoV2Loader`` and its ``vision_transformer``
factories). Checkpoints trained against those versions pickled references to those module paths,
so ``torch.load`` raises ``ModuleNotFoundError`` before the weights are even read.

This module re-registers the removed import paths in :data:`sys.modules` with lightweight
placeholder modules, so old checkpoints unpickle successfully. The placeholders only need to make
the pickled *references* resolve - the actual (frozen) encoder weights are reloaded from ``timm``
and the legacy ones are dropped by each model's ``on_load_checkpoint`` hook (see
:func:`anomalib.models.components.base.restore_frozen_encoder_weights`).

It is imported for its side effect from :mod:`anomalib.models`, so the aliases are installed before
any checkpoint is loaded.
