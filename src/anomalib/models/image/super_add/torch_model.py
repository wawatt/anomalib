"""PyTorch model for the SuperADD model implementation.

This module implements a PatchCore-style anomaly detector built on a DINOv3
backbone. Multi-layer ViT token features are extracted over overlapping image
patches, a per-layer memory bank is built from normal training images via
distance-based coreset subsampling, and test images are scored by 1-nearest-
neighbor distance to the bank.

The model stores representative patch features from normal training images and
detects anomalies by comparing test image patches against this memory bank using
nearest neighbor search.

    This model implements the SuperADD algorithm, a PatchCore-style detector
    built on a pretrained DINOv3 backbone. Multi-layer ViT token features are
    extracted over overlapping image patches, a per-layer memory bank is built
    from normal training images via distance-based coreset subsampling, and test
    images are scored by nearest-neighbor distance to the bank.

    The model works in two phases:
    1. Training: Extract patch features from normal training images and store
       them, then build a coreset memory bank via :meth:`subsample_embedding`.
    2. Inference: Compare test image patches against the memory bank using
       nearest neighbor search to produce an anomaly map and score.

    Args:
        backbone (str): Name of the timm DINOv3 backbone used for feature
            extraction. Defaults to ``"vit_small_patch16_dinov3"``.
        patch_size (int): Side length (in pixels) of the overlapping patches the
            input image is split into. Defaults to ``448``.
        patch_overlap (int): Overlap (in pixels) between neighboring patches.
            Defaults to ``16``.
        layers (list[int] | None): List of encoder layer indices to extract features from.
            If None, DINO_TARGET_LAYERS of the respective model size.
        max_database_size (int): Target number of features retained per layer
            after coreset subsampling. Defaults to ``100000``.
        subsampling_iterations (int): Number of random-subset iterations used by
            the fast subsampling routine. Defaults to ``100``.
        gaussian_blur_sigma (float): Standard deviation of the Gaussian filter
            applied to the anomaly map before scoring. Suppresses single-token
            outliers that would otherwise dominate the image score and the
            adaptive threshold. Set to ``0`` to disable. Defaults to ``4.0``.
        score_quantile (float): Fraction of the highest anomaly map pixels
            averaged into the image-level score. Using a small quantile instead
            of the single maximum keeps the score independent of the input
            resolution (number of tokens). Defaults to ``1e-3``.

    Attributes:
        backbone (DinoV3Backbone): DINOv3 feature extractor.
        patch_exec (PatchedExecution): Overlapping-patch inference wrapper.
        layers (list[int]): Indices of the extracted backbone layers.
        memory_bank (torch.Tensor): Per-layer coreset of normal patch features.

    Note:
        The model requires no optimization/backpropagation as it uses a
