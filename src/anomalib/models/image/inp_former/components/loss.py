"""Cosine Soft Mining Loss for training INP-Former model.

The code is based on the `global_cosine_hm_adaptive` method in the original implementation.
Reference: https://github.com/luow23/INP-Former/blob/5252579e5f401199643fbd16e030175856386f12/utils.py#L130-L151

    """Cosine similarity loss with hard mining and adaptive weighting based on distance ratios.

    This loss function focuses training on hard-to-reconstruct points, enabling the model to learn
    a sufficient description of normality quickly without becoming overly effective at reconstructing
    anomalous points.

    Description:
    1. Compute cosine similarity between encoder and decoder features
    2. High cosine similarity means that points are easy to reconstruct and vice versa
    3. Calculate adaptive weights by amplifying the difference between easy and hard-to-reconstruct points
    4. Apply adaptive weights to modify hard-to-reconstruct points more than easy ones
    5. Training focuses on hard-to-reconstruct points, while modifying easy-to-reconstruct points as well

    Note:
        This loss is called "Soft Mining" in the paper, presumably referring to using all points in backpropagation
        with weights applied to focus on hard-to-reconstruct points, in contrast to the "Hard Mining" which uses only
        hard-to-reconstruct points in backpropagation, ignoring others. The naming follows the original implementation
        for consistency, which uses the name `global_cosine_hm_adaptive`.
