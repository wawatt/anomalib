"""PyTorch model for the PatchCore model implementation.

This module implements the PatchCore model architecture using PyTorch. PatchCore
uses a memory bank of patch features extracted from a pretrained CNN backbone to
detect anomalies.

The model stores representative patch features from normal training images and
detects anomalies by comparing test image patches against this memory bank using
nearest neighbor search.

Example:
    >>> from anomalib.models.image.patchcore.torch_model import PatchcoreModel
    >>> model = PatchcoreModel(
    ...     backbone="wide_resnet50_2",
    ...     layers=["layer2", "layer3"],
    ...     pre_trained=True,
    ...     num_neighbors=9
    ... )
    >>> input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 3, 224, 224)
    >>> output = model(input_tensor)

    """PatchCore PyTorch model for anomaly detection.

    This model implements the PatchCore algorithm which uses a memory bank of patch
    features for anomaly detection. Features are extracted from a pretrained CNN
    backbone and stored in a memory bank. Anomalies are detected by comparing test
    image patches with the stored features using nearest neighbor search.

    The model works in two phases:
    1. Training: Extract and store patch features from normal training images
    2. Inference: Compare test image patches against stored features to detect
       anomalies

    Args:
        layers (Sequence[str]): Names of layers to extract features from.
        backbone (str, optional): Name of the backbone CNN network.
            Defaults to ``"wide_resnet50_2"``.
        pre_trained (bool, optional): Whether to use pre-trained backbone weights.
            Defaults to ``True``.
        num_neighbors (int, optional): Number of nearest neighbors to use.
            Defaults to ``9``.

    Example:
        >>> from anomalib.models.image.patchcore.torch_model import PatchcoreModel
        >>> model = PatchcoreModel(
        ...     backbone="wide_resnet50_2",

        ...     pre_trained=True,
        ...     num_neighbors=9
        ... )
        >>> input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 3, 224, 224)
        >>> output = model(input_tensor)

    Attributes:
        tiler (Tiler | None): Optional tiler for processing large images.
        feature_extractor (TimmFeatureExtractor): CNN feature extractor.
        feature_pooler (torch.nn.AvgPool2d): Average pooling layer.
        anomaly_map_generator (AnomalyMapGenerator): Generates anomaly heatmaps.
        memory_bank (torch.Tensor): Storage for patch features from training.

    Notes:
        The model requires no optimization/backpropagation as it uses a pretrained
        backbone and nearest neighbor search.
