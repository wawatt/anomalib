# GeneralAD: Anomaly Detection Across Domains by Attending to Distorted Features

This is the implementation of the [GeneralAD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12427) paper.

Model Type: Segmentation

## Description

GeneralAD is a discriminative anomaly detection method that operates across semantic, near-distribution, and industrial settings with minimal per-task adjustments. It leverages the patch-based structure of Vision Transformer hidden states and introduces a self-supervised anomaly generation module that constructs pseudo-anomalous samples by applying noise injection, shuffling, and copying operations to patch features. An attention-based discriminator is trained to score every patch in the image, enabling both accurate image-level anomaly identification and interpretable anomaly map generation.

This anomalib integration ports the core method from the original
[GeneralAD repository](https://github.com/LucStrater/GeneralAD) into anomalib's
standard model interface so it can be trained with `Engine`, used from the CLI,
and evaluated with anomalib's built-in metrics and post-processing pipeline.

## Architecture

## Usage

`anomalib train --model GeneralAD --data MVTecAD --data.category <category>`

## Local reproduction

On 2026-04-10, we verified that the anomalib `GeneralAD` integration reproduces
the upstream results on MVTec AD `toothbrush` when the evaluation is configured
to match the upstream scoring pipeline.

| Run                                   | image_AUROC | pixel_AUROC |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------: | ----------: |
| Upstream GeneralAD (original repo)    |     `0.994` |           — |
| Anomalib (default post-processing)    |     `0.967` |     `0.962` |
| **Anomalib (no score normalization)** | **`0.997`** |     `0.962` |

The key finding is that anomalib's default `PostProcessor` normalizes and clamps
`pred_score` to `[0, 1]` before the `Evaluator` computes AUROC during testing.
This normalization (`((score - threshold) / (max - min)) + 0.5`, then
`clamp(0, 1)`) is a non-monotonic transformation that can change rank ordering
and therefore AUROC. The upstream repo computes AUROC directly on raw
discriminator logits with no post-processing.

To reproduce upstream-matching results, disable normalization in the
post-processor:

```python
from anomalib.post_processing import PostProcessor

model = GeneralAD(
    ...,
    post_processor=PostProcessor(enable_normalization=False),
)
```

### Other alignment details

- The upstream train loader uses `drop_last=True`. Pass `--drop-last` to match.
- Checkpoint selection monitors `image_AUROC` on `val_split_mode=SAME_AS_TEST`,
  matching the upstream behaviour of validating on the test set.
