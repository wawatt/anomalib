"""GLASS - Unsupervised anomaly detection via Gradient Ascent for Industrial Anomaly detection and localization.

This module implements the GLASS model for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization. GLASS synthesizes both
global and local anomalies using Gaussian noise guided by gradient ascent to enhance weak defect detection in
industrial settings.

The model consists of:
    - A feature extractor and feature adaptor to obtain robust normal representations
    - A Global Anomaly Synthesis (GAS) module that perturbs features using Gaussian noise and gradient ascent with
      truncated projection
    - A Local Anomaly Synthesis (LAS) module that overlays augmented textures onto images using Perlin noise masks
    - A shared discriminator trained with features from normal, global, and local synthetic samples
